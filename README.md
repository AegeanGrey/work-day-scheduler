# work-day-scheduler

## Description

- I wanted to take this code and enhance it by adding functionality to the webpage through JavaScript.
- This webpage is meant to help a user track their daily tasks throughout a 9am-5pm work day
- I gained knowledge on how the following is utilized when building the following for the webpage:

Through JavaScript I've been able to provide functionality by providing a clock that updates it's time, a save button to store the users inputted data within local storage and correlating these two functions with one another to work hand-in-hand to show wether the time block exists within the past, present, or future.
